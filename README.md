# AlgorithmsImplementations
Implementing Dijkstra, Bellman Ford, and Depth First Search Algorithms:

Using Java, my team and I implemented Dijkstra and Bellman Ford algorithms to get the shortest distance from one school building to another.
We also implemented the Depth First Search algorithm on the list of the courses that UCA student have to take in order to graduate.
Our team successful created a schedule for order of courses each student can take each semester to minimize their time.

To run, copy paste the folders (packge level) to any project on eclipse
